# Course Recommender System
- The rise of MOOCs has resulted in an increase in online courses, making it difficult for users to identify the most suitable courses across different disciplines. To improve accessibility to quality education, it is important to suggest courses that are acceptable to the user and enhance their learning skills. The abundance of course information available on MOOC platforms like edX, Coursera, and Udacity has attracted millions of users who may find it challenging to select courses that match their learning pace and requirements. In such cases, traditional recommendation algorithms are not effective.
- The goal of this project is to create a system for recommending courses to users based on their prior learning experiences, preferred learning styles, and rate of learning. This solution can be used to bolster the user experience by providing recommendations to the user based on user preferences to reduce user efforts and help users reach their learning goals. Moreover, this will help the stakeholderâ€™s platform by improvising User experience, increasing sales, increasing user retention, and most importantly increasing revenue.

## Steps:
- 1.Web scrapping descriptive data directly from Coursera website
- 2.Data Preprocessing and Data Analysis with Text-Preprocessing Methods
- 3.Creating courses similarity matrix with topic modeling: LDA, SVD, and NMF combined with different vectorization
- 4.Recommending similar courses with high similarity score based on users' input/interest
- 5.Evaluating models based on topic coherence and further test the conclusions via A/B testing
